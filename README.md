# Soulbound
## A 2D game created with Unity
This is my first project using Unity and the current state of the game is in the Alpha stage.

## About Soulbound:
As someone who loves to play games in my spare time, I couldn't help but wonder how exactly they were created! That's how my dream was born!

Soulbound is a 2D Side-Scroller game in the Action-adventure genre. 

### Plot:
The story in the game tells about an astral world that turns out to be inhabited by cute astral nature spirits but the balance of their world has been disturbed, and the consequences of this are directly affecting the nature spirits and their habitat. The protagonist of the story also known as a "Whisperer", is called to aid the spirits and their diverse astral world.

### General gameplay mechanics:
The player will have a choice between 2 characters, each of them having different parameters. The parameter "Element" will be different for the character that is selected (For Character A it will be luminosity, similarly for Character B void).

#### Each player will be able to get a helper for their character (nature spirits or something similar), and the idea here is as follows:

* Each spirit will also have parameters and an element, this element will vary between the following: earth, water, fire and wind.
* The character chosen by the player will "synchronize" with these so-called spirits and acquire their abilities.
* During a game, each character can use up to 2 spirits, its parameters will be added to the player's parameters. 

#### The attacks that can be used by the player will be three:

* The first two (basic attack and skill 1) will be entirely related to what spirit the player has decided to use (each spirit will have its own unique abilities).
* The last skill (ultra skill) will be linked specifically to the element of the player's chosen character (i.e. Character A will have a different ultra skill than Character B), this will be the strongest attack that can be performed under given conditions during play.
