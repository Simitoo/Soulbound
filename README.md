# Soulbound
## A 2D game created with Unity
This is my first project using Unity and the current state of the game is in DEMO variant.

## About Soulbound:
As someone who loves to play games in my spare time, I can't help but wonder how exactly they were created! That's how my dream was born!

Soulbound is a 2D Side-Scroller game in the Action-adventure genre. 

### Plot:
The story in the game tells about an astral world that turns out to be inhabited by cute astral nature spirits but the balance of their world has been disturbed, and the consequences of this are directly affecting the nature spirits and their habitat.
